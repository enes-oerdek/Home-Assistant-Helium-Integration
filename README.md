## Installation :hammer_and_wrench:

Follow these simple steps to get started.

1. **Install the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)** - Before you can use this integration, you'll need to have [HACS](https://github.com/hacs/integration) installed. Haven't set it up yet? No worries! Check out the [HACS installation guide](https://hacs.xyz/docs/installation/installation) to get up and running in no time.

2. **Install the Helium Integration from HACS** - Now that our plugin has matured and found its spot in the HACS store, installation is easier than ever! Follow these straightforward steps:

    - Navigate to HACS in your Home Assistant instance
    - Select "Integrations"
    - Use the repository browser to find `Helium Integration`
    - Click on "Install this repository in HACS" button

You can also install the integration directly using this link: [Install Helium Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=enes-oerdek&repository=Home-Assistant-Helium-Integration&category=integration).

Now you're all set to enjoy the benefits of Helium integration in your Home Assistant! :tada:


## Configuration :gear:

Unleash the full power of Helium integration in your Home Assistant by following these simple steps. :star:

### Simple Configuration using Configuration Flow

1. **Home Assistant Settings**: Begin by navigating to your Home Assistant settings. Then, select "Devices and Services".

2. **Add Integration**: Look for the "+ Add Integration" button in the lower right corner, click it and search for "Helium".

   ![Configuration Steps 1 and 2](./images/configuration0.png)

3. **Configure Helium Integration**: You'll be prompted to enter the number of wallets you want to configure. If you only have one wallet, simply leave the default value. On the next screen, you'll need to enter your public address. This address can be found in the settings of the Helium Wallet App. Navigate to: Helium Wallet App (black) > Copy Address > Solana.

   ![Configuration Step 3](./images/configuration1.png)

   ![Configuration Step 4](./images/configuration2.png)

4. **Restart Home Assistant**: After the sensors and devices have loaded, you may need to reload the integration to finalize the configuration.

   ![Configuration Step 5](./images/configuration3.png)

### Advanced Configuration using `configuration.yaml`

The simple configuration method should suffice for most users. However, some beta features may only be accessible through the advanced configuration method.

1. **Update your `configuration.yaml`** - Add the following code snippet to your `configuration.yaml` file:
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: helium_solana
```

This one-liner will introduce new sensors for the prices of HNT, IOT, MOBILE, and SOL, providing you with valuable insights right at your fingertips! :gem:

*Optional*: If you are interested in your wallet stats as well, you need to add the "wallets" part in your configuration as well.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: helium_solana
    wallets:
    - SOLANA WALLET ADDRESS HERE
```
Replace "SOLANA WALLET ADDRESS HERE" with your Solana Wallet Address. You can find this address in the settings of the black Helium App > Copy Address > Solana. Your resulting configuration might look like this:
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: helium_solana
    wallets:
    - rAwOnpD26GH8FcEo1H4ng3MPPsN8C5KdZ7N7MqAS
```


3. **Customize your dashboard** - Now that your sensors are set up, it's time to add them to your Home Assistant dashboard. Check out the examples below for inspiration and create a personalized display that suits your needs.

4. **Introduce Automations** - Stay ahead of the game by setting up automations to be notified of major price changes! :mega: Create an automation using the newly introduced price data, so you're always in the know when it comes to your investments.

Your Home Assistant is now supercharged with Helium integration, giving you unparalleled control and insights into your smart home ecosystem! :tada:
This will introduce new sensors with the prices of HNT, IOT, MOBILE and SOL. You can now add these sensors into your dashboard (see examples).

## Examples :rainbow:

```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: sensor.helium_wallet_[YOUR ID HERE]_hnt_balance
    name: HNT Account
  - entity: sensor.helium_wallet_[YOUR ID HERE]_iot_balance
    name: IOT Account
